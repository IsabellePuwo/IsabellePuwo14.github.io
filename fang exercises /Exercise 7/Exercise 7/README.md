# DESCRIPTION: 

In order to enable each object to input their information and add the course for that semester, this application will define a member function for the Instructor class and construct an Instructor class. Depending on how many credits and students an instructor is teaching, the computer will also determine whether they are overloaded.

The instructor's personal information, such as name and information about the course they are teaching, such as course name, credit total, and student count, would be input for the member functions.

As part of the program's development, member functions like "InputInformation" and "addCourse" would be defined. These functions would accept user input and save it as object attributes.The program will then check if the instructor is overloaded by comparing the number of credits and students taught to the overload thresholds of 9 credits and 40 students. The application will flag the teacher as being overwhelmed if the thresholds are exceeded.

An Instructor object with the instructor's contact information and the courses they are instructing that semester would be the program's output. Depending on the overload levels, the application will also indicate whether or not the instructor is overloaded.
